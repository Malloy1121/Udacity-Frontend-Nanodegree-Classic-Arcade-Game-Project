===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


##Before you start playing this game

* Download the .zip file and uncompressed it to your local device.
* Go to the folder and open "index.html" file with your browser (Chrome is recommended).

##How to play this game

###Choosing your favorite character
* Before starting, you can choose a character you like by clicking on it.
* The selected character willhave a yellow square background.

###Starting and stopping the game
* To start this game, you can click on the "Start" button with blue background.
* To stop it, you can click on the "Stop" button with red background.

###Moving your character
* After you start this game, you can press "up" "down" "left" and "right" key on the keyboard.

###Polishing your scoreboard
* Get Gems and Keys as many as possible!
* Get to the river! When you get to the river, your character's location will be reset.

###How to survive
* Don't let those bugs touch you.
* Once a bug touches you, your life will decrease by 1, and your location will be reset.
* You only can respawn 3 times by default.
* Fortunately, gaining a heart or a key grants you an extra opportunity to play.
* A key or a heart may spawn every time you spawn, but the probability is random and not so great.
